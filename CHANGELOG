* Fri Nov 20 2020 Liz Nemsick <lnemsick.simp@gmail.com> - 2.6.2-0
- Fixed a bug in which the module would attempt to create `selinux_login`
  resources when `selinux::login_resources` was set but selinux was disabled.
  This resulted in an error message 'Could not find a suitable provider
  for selinux_login' during catalog compilation.

* Wed Nov 18 2020 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> - 2.6.1-0
- Allow users to include `selinux::install` without needing full SELinux system
  management. This is particularly important when the native types are to be
  used in different modules but you don't want to include full management just
  to get the required packages.

* Mon Sep 21 2020 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> - 2.6.0-0
- No longer enable or install mcstransd by default
  - It is a user convenience feature and not required for core functionality
- Ensure that mcstransd is added to the GID assigned to `/proc` if one is
  assigned on the system

  without conflict

* Mon Apr 23 2018 Jeanne Greulich <jeanne.greulich@onyxpoint.com> - 2.2.0-0
- simp_options::selinux was supposed to indicate if the selinux module should
  be included. Class include lists set in the simp module would include selinux
  regardless of this setting.  This option was also being used to set the state
  of selinux.  This caused confusion so  simp_options::selinux setting was
  removed.  The selinux state, set by the ensure parameter, is defaulted to
  'enforcing'.  This will result in the same behavior as if simp_options::selinux
  was set to true.  See the pupmod-simp-simp module to see which scenarios
  include selinux by default.
